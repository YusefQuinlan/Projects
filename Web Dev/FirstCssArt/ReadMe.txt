This artwork isn't great and can probably be improved in many ways, however it is my first attempt at css artwork
and was a good opportunity to explore several aspects of border-radius and absolute positioning. I may improve on this
over time, and produce a more refined version of this artwork. Other than that, hope you enjoy it!
