These python files attempt to portray the new daily cases worldwise 
They use data from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data, this source/url may
not supply this information foreveer however.

The outputs are not perfect, many improvements could be made, lines could be drawn to
better demonstrate values, and seperating the outputs into sub-plots might make some things clearer.
That being said in my opinion they do a good job of demonstrating the progression of Covid-19.


https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data is my source of data, it is publicly available
and I and anyone else who wishes to use this information may do so as of the 28 of May 2020. 
This may change but as of the above date it was publicly available and free to use.
