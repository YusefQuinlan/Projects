These python files attempt to portray the new daily cases worldwide 
They use data from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data, this source/url may
not supply this information forever however. This particular python file shows the new cases
day to day, and creates a jpg of a plot of this data over a time-series. It creates a jpg
for each country included in the original data.

The outputs are not perfect, many improvements could be made, lines could be drawn to
better demonstrate values, and seperating the outputs into sub-plots might make some things clearer.
That being said in my opinion they do a good job of demonstrating the progression of Covid-19.


https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data is my source of data, it is publicly available
and I and anyone else who wishes to use this information may do so as of the 28 of May 2020
 (this was their policy at this time, and this was when the data was available to me). 
This may change but as of the above date it was publicly available and free to use.
