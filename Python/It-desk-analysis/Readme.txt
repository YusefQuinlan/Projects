This data taken from https://fsadata.github.io/it-service-desk-records/data/it-service-desk-records-19dec16-9jan17.csv
is open data, for me it was downloaded as an xlsx file. It shows some IT desk records for 16-dec 2016 - 9Jan07.
I am not sure who the IT-desk's clients are, just that the data was published by the food standards agency.
At any rate, the python file just prints out the percentage of requests that have been resolved by the IT desk,
for three request categories 'Incident, Major Incident and Service request'.
