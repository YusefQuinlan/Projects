This plugin has been made for a third party client that runs
on top of the client for the popular MMORPG OldSchoolRunescape.
The plugin allows players to carry out certain dangerous monster
killing activites in a manner that allows them to maximise their 
time away from screen, by alerting them when they have killed a monster,
once they get the alert they can take actions to initiate killing of a monster
and they can look away from there screen and do whatever other action they wish
knowing that the plugin will alert them when they need to kill another monster.

In certain activities and game modes of OldSchoolRunescape, it is possible for
players to kill eachother, and it is possible to kill monsters in the same way
as above mentioned. But in these game modes the risk of getting killed by other players
makes that difficult. This plugin provides the users an alert that shouts 'RUN RUN RUN!'
when other players are nearby, this may give them enough time to be able to run away and
not get attacked by players who wish to kill them. So essentially they can kill monsters
in the above mentioned away from screen/keyboard way without having to worry too much about
being killed by players, as the plugin alerts the user of both players who can kill them
and monster deaths. Alerts can be turned on or off where needed.
