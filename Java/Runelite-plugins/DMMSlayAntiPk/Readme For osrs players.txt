This plugin is for world45 use or use on wilderness slayer tasks in unpopulated areas.
You will have to edit the filepaths in DMMSlayAntiPk.java to the filepaths of the two
au files 'RUN' and 'DIE'. Essentially this runelite plugin shouts the wordsc'RUN RUN RUN'
Whenever another player enters your map, so that you can escape them before they get near you,
it also shouts the works 'AN NPC HAS DIED!' so that you can afk slayer tasks in the 
wilderness (regular worlds) or afk an safespottable npcs on deadman without having to worry 
about getting pked. You can also turn of sound effects and study or watch a movie etc
as the plugin will notify you of an npc death. Be warned that this will shout at you
even when an npc is killed by another npc or another player and so is not suitable 
in all game areas.

You can put this project in the plugins folder in runelite and see it in your plugins
bar.
