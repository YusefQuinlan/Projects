These plugins have been made for use with the third party client Runelite.
Runelite is a client that adds extra functionality to the game OldSchoolRunescape,
it is both legal and permitted by the creator of the game (Jagex) as it does not
use injection technology and does not directly allow for the use of macros in any
official capacity. The plugins I have made are both for myself and any other users
who would wish to use them, and I hope they will be used responsibly.
