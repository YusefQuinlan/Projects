The idea behind this program is that a user can enter various details about a person into a csv file,
the user will be asked if they wish to add a person to a csv file when the file starts up, they will then be asked for
details of the user (name etc). after they have added all details, they will be added once again if they wish to add
another person to the csv file. Note that if the csv file does not exist, then it will be created, otherwise
details may or may not be added depending on user response. Once the program terminates the details and persons
shall be added to the csv file. Note that the Person.java file contains a class that is not used, this is not accidental
, I have simply done this to demonstrate that I know how to make a class in Java and hinting that I could have used the
class to implement this functionality. I chose not to as it was not really complicated enough a function to warrant
the use of a class. There are a few problems with this program, but for more information on that you can look
at my comment on the Main.java file in the src folder.
