These simple shapes have been made in C via the code::blocks IDE,
I have no idea how they run outside of code::blocks as I do not have the knowledge of C
to allow me to test them, I also didn't/may not know what happens in terms of memory allocation
after the c program has terminated as at the time I did not know much about memory allocation
and things such as dereferencing.

In addition, the shapes are not perfect and not very artsy, the idea was really for me to geet used
to creating algorithms in C. I chose to do so by implementing simple shapes with ASCII.

The all shapes program just prints out all the shapes into the same system, each algorithm is seperated by and
put into its own brackets. This is just so the variable are only used within these bracket scopes, so that
there are no conflicts in declaring the same global variables twice.
