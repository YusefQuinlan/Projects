I know that there are problems with the above, but it just attempts to add people to an existing
csv, one that is made if it doesn't exist. Its not great because first of all it adds first name and
last name every time it is run, and the insert() function doesn't allow you to not enter a person if you didn't 
want to do so. I am new to C and it is far harder than python and a little harder than Java. That being said,
I am enjoying it.
